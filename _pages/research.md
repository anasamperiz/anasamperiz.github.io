<h3>PhD thesis - From watershed to reef: reconstructing the history of land use change and coral reef health in Fiji</h3> 

My current project focuses on disentangling how climate change and land use are impacting the growth of massive reef-building coral (<i>Porites</i>) in Fiji, and how abrupt terrestrial discharges into coastal ecosystems are linked to coral degradation.

Coral reefs are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems on Earth due to their high sensitivity to environmental changes in their habitats. Reef-building corals show limited tolerance to changes in light availability, climate and current patterns, sedimentation, salinity, pH and increasing temperature. These organisms face different threats as a result of changes in their environment. Natural disturbances, such as climatic events and tropical storms are short-lasting and infrequent enough as to enable recovery of the reefs, but chronic anthropogenic impacts (e.g. fishing practices, land-use, climate change) produce a constant cumulative stress caused by increasing of water pollutants, sediments and/or nutrients, as well as increment of seawater temperature and acidification. 

In this project I aim to disentangle the relationships between coral gowth, water quality and climatic events in Fijian inshore reefs, and reconstruct the sensitivity of reef-building corals to environmental changes in the last century. 

The main research questions we are addressing are: 
  1.	How does coral growth change across space and time in Fijian inshore reefs?
  2.	How do environmental conditions and climatic events affect different inshore reefs in Fiji. 
  3.	Can massive Porites corals be used as inshore water quality proxy?

Understanding the response of massive long-lived corals to environmental changes over time, as a result of climate and biogeochemical shifts, is critical for the assessment of the future of modern coral reefs. 

To address these questions, I am using an interdisciplinary approach that couples traditional geochemical techniques (i.e. Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, Sr/Ca,… ) and computed tomography (CT) to reconstruct seasonal changes in coral growth (i.e. linear extension, density and calcification) from massive long-lived <i>Porites</i> corals under a range of different catchment environments (agricultural, urban and forested) and a number of stress events (e.g. thermal stress, cyclones).


<h3>MRes - Stylasterids: A new paleoceanographic archive?</h3>

Stylasterids are a commonly found deep-sea coral taxon that build their skeletons from either calcite or aragonite (or both). Their potential as paleoceanographic archives remains unexplored and robust geochemical proxy data collected from modern specimens is very limited. 

Ninety-three stylasterids were selected from locations including the Southern Ocean, Equatorial Atlantic, North Atlantic and Galápagos Islands spanning a range of depths from 63 to 2894 m and temperatures from 0 to 17°C. Samples were identified up to species level when possible. They included 20 species belonging to 7 genera. These were Adelopora sp., Cheiloporidion sp., Conopora sp., Errina sp., Errinopsis sp., Inferiolabiata sp., and Stylaster sp. Fifty-six specimens were analysed for skeletal mineralogy. Sixteen samples were calcitic, and 40 were aragonitic. 

Oxygen and carbon (δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>13</sup>C) isotopic composition was measured in all the specimens. Five specimens were sub-sampled in the main trunk, secondary branches and growing tips. All data were below equilibrium, with the tips of the colonies having the lightest values, and the trunk being the heaviest. The δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>13</sup>C range within a single specimen is lower compared to published values in deep-sea scleractinian corals. All the specimens were subsampled in the main trunk. Their δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>13</sup>C was measured and compared to local hydrographic data to gain insight into calcification mechanisms and test their use as paleotemperature archives. Different isotopic values were found between aragonitic and calcitic samples. Calcitic corals showed less depleted values from equilibrium for δ<sup>18</sup>O but a higher depletion forδ<sup>13</sup>C. 

<p>The data indicate that environmental temperature is recorded in the skeletal chemistry of stylasterid corals. A global δ<sup>18</sup>O:temperature calibration for aragonitic stylasterids was produced. This calibration showed a mean depletion of 0.97‰ from equilibrium. This work highlights the potential application of stylasterid coral δ<sup>18</sup>O data to reconstruct ancient seawater temperature.

BSc dissertation - Design, implementation and evaluation of an Environmental Education Program in a Summer Camp

The requirement of looking for solutions to face the actual environmental crisis has raised environmental education (EE) as an essential tool for formation and training. The main objective is turning people into responsible environmental citizens. 

Since its inception in 1968 to the present, EE has been built in several national and international institutions, which have applied it from different approaches. However, non-formal EE has been more successful in looking for a critical reflection of our actual society. 

The objective of this dissertation is the design, implementation and evaluation of a non-formal EE program in a summer camp called “Confluencias” (confluences), carried out in July 2014, and, also, reaching knowledge and attitude changes towards the environment in the participants: 76 teenagers between 14 and 17 years old. The activities which compound the program deal with related content about country side and urban environment. Pre-activity and post-activity surveys were used for the assessment, which data was analyzed by the Wilcoxon test to related samples. 

The results showed that there were no changes in the knowledge and perception about the environment, but important differences in the attitudes the subjects showed were found, mainly about their roles in the environmental care and how the environmental status is able to influence their day by day. In conclusion, the target was reached partially and the methodology used for the realization of the program was adequate and does not present problems in its development.
