### Cardiff University 
I co-supervised (together with my supervisor Dr Sindia Sosdian) the research project of a MSci student. For this project, they examined the potential drivers of bioerosion in massive <i>Porites</i> on an inshore reef in Fiji. For this, the student quantified annual bioerion rates on different coral cores through the use of computed tomogrphy (CT).

I assisted in the implementation of practical sessions as 'demonstrator' in the following undergraduate modules: 
- Coral Reefs (Years 2019-2020, 2020-2021)
- Marine Environmental Systems (Year 2021-2022)
- Biogeochemistry (Years 2019-2020, 2020-2021)    
- Earth surface processes (Year 2018-2019)
