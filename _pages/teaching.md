#### Cardiff University 
I co-supervised (together with my PhD main supervisor Dr Sindia Sosdian) the research project of a MSci student. For this project they examined the potential drivers of bioerosion in massive <i>Porites</i> on an inshore reef in Fiji. For this, the student quantified annual bioerion rates on different coral cores through the use of computed tomogrphy (CT).
