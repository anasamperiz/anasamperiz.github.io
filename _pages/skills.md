title: "What can I do?"

## Methods and lab skills
The primary methodologies and lab-based activities I have aquired during my career include:
 - Data acquisition through computerised tomography (CT) and processing of CT images. 
 - Analysis of trace elements in biogenic carbonates with Laser Ablation (LA) - ICPMS and data processing. 
 - Stable isotope (ẟ<sup>13</sup>C and ẟ<sup>18</sup>O) analysis in marine carbonates.
 - Physical and chemical cleaning of marine samples and sample preparation for AMS and MC-ICP-MS analyses.
 - Stylasterid and scleractinian corals morphological identification up to species level.
 - SEM imaging

I also have some experience with XRD analysis and Raman spectroscopy. 

## In the office
- Remote Sensing: I have experience collecting and processing remote sensing environmental data (Level 2 and Level 3) to use in my research. These include derived variables from ocean color (e.g. seawater turbidity, chlorophyll-a concentration, particulate organic and inorganic matter), seawater temperature and salinity, cloud cover, wind speed and direction and precipitation. 
- R: The majority of my data analysis is done in R. This includes tidying databases, statistical analysis, data visualization and spatial analysis. 
- GIS: I use ArcGIS and QGIS to map and ilustrate environmental spatial data obtained through remote sensing. 
- Ocean Data View (ODV) to visualise oceanographic data. 
- I also have wide experience in environmental education and science communication, including organisation, design and implementation of activities. 

## Fieldwork experience
### ICY-LAB - DY081
During the DY081 expedition (July - August 2017) we sailed around the Labrador Sea in the NW Atlantic collecting samples of of seawater, particles, sediments and biological specimens, all the way from surface waters to within the seafloor sediments. 

My responsabilities on board included sorting and curating biological specimens, both living and fossil samples. I also helped deploying CTDs, and sediment coring instruments and onboard water sampling. 

### COACTION - Fiji 2019
During this field campaign we collected a 50cm long core from a massive Diploastrea spp. colony covering a span of over 100 years. 

I am a certified Open Water diver.
